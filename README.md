The goals of this challenge were to use Python to perform two different tasks: analyze financial records to determine various metrics such as total profit/losses and average change, and analyze poulation data to help a town modernize its vote-counting process with metrics such as total votes and winners of an election.

Each of these tasks are housed in their respective folders within this repository. The analysis for the company financial records is in "PyBank" and the analysis for the voting records is in "PyPoll".

In each folder, there is a file called "main.py" that contains the Python script used in each situation, a folder called "Resources" that contains the CSV files used in the analysis, and a folder called "Analysis" that contains the text file of the results of the analysis.
